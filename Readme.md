# Mars Real Estate

### An app that lets you browse, purchase and put to sale properties on Mars ü™ê

Obviously you can't *really* buy properties on mars with this app


All of the properties are stored locally with the Room database, they are **not** hosted on a remote server.


## Features

* Browse properties, filter and sort them
* Mark property as favorite to find them easily ( this is saved on disk)
* Swipe to delete favorites
* Viewpager2 to see additional photos üì∑
* Add a new property to sell/rent it, and import a photo from the camera or the file system
* If you take of photo with the app, it will be saved in the pictures folder
* Share a property with a link, this link can be opened with the app to directly go to the property's page
* Login/Logout with credentials stored in encrypted preferences
* Biometric login (will log you in as a default user if the biometric authentication succeeds)
* Payment flow with credit card form and recap ( successful purchase will only add the property to your favorites and send you a notification)
* Night mode üåô
* Option to choose a larger font size for the app
* Transitions between routes, various animations in the app

## Architecture

This app heavily relies on the **Android Jetpack** components, notably using

* Fragments
* Navigation
* ViewModel and LiveData (databinding)
* Room
* Test environment


Most of the UI is also built with the help of [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)

It is also made with the old **xml** system, not jetpack compose

## Compatibility

| Data              | Value       |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Language          | Kotlin      |
| Minimum APi Level | 21          |
| compileSdkVersion | 33          |
| targetSdkVersion  | 33          |

App tested on Android API levels **21**, **25**, **29** and with screens **4.65" 320dpi**, **5.0" 420dpi** and **6.18" 408dpi**

Unit tests and integration tests are present for some viewmodels and fragments

Since the app was made a few years ago, some functions it uses are now deprecated (notably in tests)
