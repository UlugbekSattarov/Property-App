<!--     Before API 23, we have to use a bitmap if we don't want the image to be stretched.
         A vector asset could be displayed but it would be stretched to fit the screen size which doesn't look good -->
<!--        We can't reference directly the @mipmap folder so we have to use an asset from @drawable-->
